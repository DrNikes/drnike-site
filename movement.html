  <h1>Movement</h1>
  <p>Simple, sustainable movement ideas designed to support long-term health.</p>

  <h2>What we focus on</h2>
  <p>
    Movement here is not about extreme workouts or performance metrics.
    It’s about consistency, joint-friendly motion, and habits that fit into real life.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples you might see</h2>
  <p>
    • Daily mobility routines  
    • Low-impact strength ideas  
    • Walking, posture, and basic coordination  
    • Movement as recovery, not punishment
  </p>
